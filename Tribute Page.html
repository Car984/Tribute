<li>The sport developed in the 1960's and '70's, grew in popularity in the 1980's, and became an Olympic Sport in 1998.</li>

<li>Believed to have originated in the US.</li>

<li>The precursor of the model snowboard came in 1965, when engineer Sherman Poppen of Muskegon, Michigan ("father of the snowboard") paved the way for modern boards. The "Snurfer".</li>

<li>The "Snurfer", which started as just a toy for Poppen's daughter, the popularity quickly spread beyond their backyard and attracted Brunswick Corporation (sports equipment manufacturer), which licensed the Snrfer and began production and distribution nationwide.</li>

<li>Local Michigan Snurfer competitions followed in the late '60's.</li>

<li>Approximately 1 million Snurfers had been sold by the end of the 1970's and brought the idea of sliding sideways on the snow to a new crop of inventors and pioneers, who took the concept and ran with it.</li>

<li>In 1975, Dimitrije Milovich's new snowboard, the "WintersticK", attracted the attention of Newsweek magazine.</li>

<li>The fanfare brought about even more refinements as well as many of the first snowboard companies like Burton, Sims, Barefoot and Gnu.</li>


<li>Jake Burton, Tom Sims, Chuck Barfoot and Mike Olson organized the first official snowboard competition.</li>

<li>In 1982 the first National Snow Surfing Championships held at Suicide Six ski resort in South Pomfret, VT was held, and won by Burton's team.</li>

<li>In 1983 the first Halfpipe competition was held in Soda Springs, CA and was organized by Tom Sims.</li>

<li>In 1985 Tom Sims stood in as Roger Moore's stunt double for the snowboarding scene in the James Bond movie A View to a Kill, which helped fuel and grow the popularity of the sport.</li>

<li>In the mid 1980's few ski resorts allowed snowboarders on their hills. France was welcoming snowboarders. At few resorts where snowboarders were allowed, they would first have to pass a competency test before being allowed on the slopes.</li>

<li>In 1985, Absolutely Radical the first snowboarding magazine was released and reflected the nonconformist grunge and hip-hop inspired styles of dress usually found worn by snowboarders.</li>

<li>Acceptance came when popularity started to grow and insurances companies began allowing ski resorts to cover snowboarding under their existing policies. </li>

<li>In 1994 Snowboarding was finally recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</li>

<li>In 1998 Snowboarding had its debut at the Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. There were 4 events total. Men and Women's Slalom, and Men and Women's Halfpipe.</li>

<li>In 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the Halfpipe event was broadcast as prime-time in the US and the Americans dominated the winter's podium.</li>

<li>In 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy the Halfpipe was again the centerpiece of the Games and Boardercross debuted.</li>

<li>In 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada the Halfpipe had reached mainstream when Shaun White captivated the crowd landing the first McTwist 1260 winning him the gold and Torah Bright winning the Women's Gold in Halfpipe.</li>
